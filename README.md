# Interactive Plots using Plotly Express
Want to make super cool interactive plots on the fly? Use [Plotly-Express](https://github.com/plotly/plotly_express)!! :smile:

Here I have taken a sample dataset of GDP per Capita vs Life Expectancy of numerous Countries of the world. 

## Installation:
Just running *pip install plotly_express==0.4.1* in your terminal will do the needful and forget it!

**Note: You should also have [Plotly](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py) installed before installing this library, as itâ€™s basically a wrapper for Plotly.py that exposes a simple syntax for complex charts.**

Usage:
Just go through the given Jupyter notebook to have a brief overview of it's capabilities, rest of it you can try yourself !
